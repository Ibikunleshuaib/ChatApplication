# ChatApp By Shuaib

A simple real time chat application that was built with React on the frontend and Node.js on the backend. 
On the frontend, components were declared in functions and react hooks such as useState, useEffect and useRef were employed, while the state was managed using context API. 
On the backend, the real time communication was as achieved using socket.io which allows for real time data tansafer. 

## Deployment
The frontend was deployed on netlify and the backend runs on heroku. The two are connected using Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) technology.
